> In our ongoing "debate" on TDD, Bob and I have discorvered that we agree that software architecture has an impotatn place in development, though we likely have different visions of exactly what that means...Yet attentiveness to detail is an even more critical foundation of professionalism than is any grand vision. 
> First, it is through practice in the small that professionals gain proficiency and trust for practice in the large. Second, the smallest bit of sloppy construction, of the door that does not close tightly or the slightly crooked tile on the floor, or even the messy desk, completely dispels the charm of the larger whole. _That is what clean code is about._

## Five S Principle
- _Seiri_, or organization (think sort in English). Knowing where things are --using approaches such as suitable naming--is crucial.
- _Seiton_, or tidiness (think systemize in English). There is an old American saying: _A place for everything, and everything it its place_. A piece of code should be where you expect to find it-- and, if not, you should re-factor to get it there
- _Seiso_, or cleaning (think shine in English): Keep the workplace free of hanging wires, grease, scraps, and waste.
- _Seiketsu_, or standardization: The group agrees about how to keep the workplace clean
- _Shutsuke_, or discipline. This means having the discipliine to follow the practices and to frequently reflect on one's work and be willing to change.

> In code, refactor mercilessly.
--- 
> We abandon our code early, not because it is done, but because our value system focuses more on outward appearance than on the substance of what we deliver.
--- 
> We should view our code as the beautiful articulation of noble efforts of design--design as a process, not a static endpoint.

# Introduction

> There are two parts to learning _craftsmanship_: knowledge & work. You must gain the knowledge of principles, patterns, practices and heuristics that a craftsman knows, and you must also grind that knowledge into your fingers, eyes and gut by working hard and practicing.
---  
> ...It is not the heuristics themselves that are so valuable, it is the _relationship between those heuristics and the discrete decisions we made while cleaning up the code in the case studies._
